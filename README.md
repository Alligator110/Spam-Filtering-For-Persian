Spam detection for the Persian language based on a revised version of the [Naive Bayes text classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) proposed by [Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_%28computer_programmer%29). A spam corpus for Persian (partially included in this repo) was constructed for the project. For in-depth information please consult the included PDF file. 

The project initially borrowed its general structure from this [repo](https://github.com/fmenozzi/spam-filter) but now they are very different in their logic.
